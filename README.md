# React Frugal

This is as fork from the excellent [react-wastage-monitor](https://github.com/MalucoMarinero/react-wastage-monitor),
the only difference is:

  * An arguably shorter name
  * Deep-diff support

It looks something like this:

More fun than expanding the object tree to try and see
manually exactly what changed.

The deep-diff support is completely stolen from the excellent
[redux-logger](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-logger).

As you can now plainly see, this repository is but thievery,
cunningly combined for craftspeople to consume.

## Why is this not in the original project?

Because I need it now! :TM: but please remind me to submit a pull request
to the upstream project later so that this fork becomes redundant.
